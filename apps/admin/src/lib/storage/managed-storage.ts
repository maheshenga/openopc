/**
 * Centralized, quota-resilient localStorage.
 *
 * The whole origin shares ONE ~5–10MB localStorage bucket. Every store, cache
 * and feature flag writes into it. Historically a few caches were keyed by the
 * *ephemeral* per-sandbox server id (`kortix_cache_sessions:<serverId>`, …) and
 * never evicted — so every new session minted a fresh set of keys that piled up
 * forever. Eventually the bucket saturated and the *next* `setItem` from *any*
 * store threw `QuotaExceededError` synchronously, crashing whatever happened to
 * write next (often something tiny and innocent, like the tab list).
 *
 * This module is the single chokepoint that keeps the bucket healthy:
 *
 *  1. `safeSetItem` NEVER throws. On a quota error it reclaims space by evicting
 *     the oldest *disposable* cache entries (across every registered family),
 *     then retries — and if it still can't fit, it gives up silently instead of
 *     crashing the UI. Losing a disposable cache is free; it just refetches.
 *  2. `ScopedCache` is the right way to write a per-scope cache: it stamps each
 *     entry with a timestamp and prunes its family to the N most-recent scopes
 *     on every write, so an ephemeral key space can't grow unbounded.
 *  3. `createSafeJSONStorage` gives every zustand `persist` store the same
 *     never-throw guarantee, so no store can ever be the crash site again.
 *
 * Anything that should be sacrificed under memory pressure must register its
 * key family here (ScopedCache does this for you). Durable user preferences are
 * deliberately NOT registered, so they survive a reclaim.
