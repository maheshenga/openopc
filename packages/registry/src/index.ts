/**
 * @kortix/registry — the Kortix registry + marketplace DISCOVERY primitives.
 *
 * A shadcn-compatible registry format plus the primitives to turn any Kortix
 * repo into a registry (`buildRegistry`), resolve an item from GitHub / a URL /
 * disk (`loadItem` / `loadRegistry`), and validate/author items.
 *
 * There is no deterministic install engine here anymore: adding a marketplace
 * item to a project is an AGENT IMPORT (the agent reads the source and merges
 * the files it wants, landing a change request) — see the `kortix-marketplace`
 * skill. `kortix registry` remains a developer authoring/discovery entrypoint.
