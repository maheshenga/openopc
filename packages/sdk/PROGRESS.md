# `@kortix/sdk` — progress

**Single source of truth for *state*** across every session and every plan. Not for
design (that's a spec) and not for *how* (that's a plan). This file indexes them.

> **Multiple sessions run against this repo.** Read this file **before** starting
> work, and update it **before** ending your turn. Both are mandatory.

**Scope:** everything `@kortix/sdk`. The **Now** section below tracks one plan at a
time. Work outside that plan lives in **Next** and **Backlog** — it is real, it is
tracked, and it is not forgotten just because it isn't scheduled.

**Never delete a row.** Mark it `WON'T DO (reason)` and leave it. A deleted row is
a decision nobody can audit.

**Found work mid-task? Do not do it.** Append it to **Backlog** or **Discovered
this session**, finish the task you claimed, and tell the user. Scope creep inside
a task is how a 146-file move becomes unreviewable.

**Multi-step work does not become a Task.** The **Now** chain comes from one plan
document. New multi-step work earns its own spec → plan → chain. Backlog rows are
single, self-contained changes.

---

## "Can I run three agents, each picking a task?" — No.

Read this before you try. It is the most expensive mistake available here.

**This file is a handoff across _time_, not a work queue across _space_.** It exists
so a session that starts tomorrow knows what yesterday's finished. It does **not**
make the tasks parallelisable.

Two independent reasons:

**1. The Now chain is a chain.** Task 4 moves **146 files** (97 source + 49 colocated
tests). A file move has *no behaviour to assert* — the only proof you moved files
rather than renamed an export is that **Task 3's snapshot did not budge**. Start 4
before 3 lands and the riskiest change in the plan runs with no net. 5 needs 4's
tree; 6 needs 5's surface; 8 bundles 5's final shape.

**2. Sessions in the same worktree share one filesystem and one git index.** Agent B
running `bun test` while Agent A is mid-`git mv` does not read a stale file — it
reads a file that no longer exists. The claim commits race too: both
`git add PROGRESS.md && git commit`, and one loses.

And there is nowhere to hide: Tasks 4 and 5 touch **both export maps**, `src/index.ts`,
`src/index.isomorphic.test.ts`, and 146 moved files — nearly every file in the
package. No second task avoids collision.

### What the claim protocol actually buys

Only this: **two sessions never do the same task.** It is not a lock on the tree, and
it does not make a chain into a queue. Do not read it as permission to fan out.

### What _can_ run in parallel

| Stream | Where | Safe? |
|---|---|---|
| The Now chain (Tasks 1→10) | `suna-ts-sdk`, one session | ✅ — parallelise **inside** it with subagents, never across sessions |
| **Lumen productionisation** | a **separate worktree** (`pnpm worktree create --name lumen-prod`) | ✅ — touches `apps/whitelabel-demo/src/server/*` only. Zero overlap with `packages/sdk`. Needs its own spec first. |
| RN transport seam | — | ❌ edits `src/state/event-stream.ts`, the exact file Task 4 moves |
| Backlog B1/B2/B3 | — | ❌ all add exports; collides with Task 5's barrel rewrite. Do them **after** Task 5. |

Throughput inside the SDK comes from **subagents within one session**
(`superpowers:subagent-driven-development`), sequenced against the chain — not from
concurrent top-level sessions.

---

## Protocol for sessions

Git is the only lock we have, and it is advisory. Behave accordingly. This protocol
guards **sequential** sessions (and the rare deliberate second worktree), not a
free-for-all.

**Before you start**

1. `git pull` (or rebase) so you are not reading a stale table.
2. If a task is `IN PROGRESS` and `Last touched` is within ~24h, **do not take
  it** — another session owns it. Take the next `NOT STARTED` task whose
   dependencies are `DONE`.
3. Claim it: set status `IN PROGRESS`, add your session id and the date, and
   **commit that one-line change by itself, before doing any work:**

       git add packages/sdk/PROGRESS.md
       git commit -m "chore(sdk): claim Task N"

   A claim made after the work is a report, not a lock.

**Before you finish**

4. Update the row: `DONE (sha)`, or back to `NOT STARTED` / `BLOCKED (reason)`.
   A task left `IN PROGRESS` by a session that ended is a lie the next session
   will believe.
5. **Append a session-log entry.** Appends merge cleanly across branches; table
   edits conflict. Short on turn? Append anyway.

**Stale claims.** `IN PROGRESS`, older than ~24h, no commits touching its files →
abandoned. Take it over and say so in the log. Never overwrite silently.

**Never mark `DONE` without pasting the evidence** — the commands you ran and their
real output. `typecheck` is not evidence.

## 2026-07-15 Studio Phase 1 SDK Claim

- Owner: Codex
- Scope: Add `kortix.project(projectId).studio` plus `@kortix/sdk/react` Studio hooks.
- Public surface: additive only; no new SDK subpath.
- Required gates: typecheck, test, public-surface snapshot, smoke install.
- Plan: `docs/specs/2026-07-15-kortix-studio-phase1-implementation-plan.md`
- Status: active

---

## NOW — active plan: v2 structure & distribution

- **Plan:** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-10-sdk-v2-structure-and-distribution.md`
- **Spec:** `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-10-sdk-v2-structure-and-distribution-design.md`
- **Kickoff prompt:** `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-10-sdk-v2-execution-prompt.md`

**Ordering is load-bearing.** Each task is the safety net for the next. Task 3's
snapshot is the *only* test Task 4 has, because a file move has no behaviour to
assert. **Do not run out of order. Do not parallelise.** Dependencies are strictly
`1 → 2 → … → 10`; only 7, 8 and 10 have slack, and only after 6.

Statuses: `NOT STARTED` · `IN PROGRESS` · `BLOCKED (reason)` · `DONE (sha)` · `WON'T DO (reason)`

### Hard stops — bring these to Jay, do not decide alone

- [ ] **Task 2, first run.** Nothing has ever installed and imported the tarball. A failure is a **real pre-existing bug**, not something to loop on. Report it.
- [ ] **Task 3, before committing the snapshot.** It becomes ground truth for everything after.
- [ ] **Task 5, Step 12 — the snapshot diff.** Additions fine. **A removal or rename means a broken consumer.** Never accept the diff to reach green.
- [x] **Task 9, Step 6.** Real browser, live stack, real sandbox. D2a (streaming through the IIFE global) and D3 (`instanceof Kortix.ApiError` under the bundle) cannot be claimed without it. — **Executed 2026-07-12, both PASS** (Chromium + live stack + real PAT/sandbox; see session log).

Also stop if the same failure survives three different fixes (use
`superpowers:systematic-debugging`), or you are about to change what a test asserts.

## NEXT — committed, needs a spec before it starts

Real work, deliberately not scheduled. **Do not start these.** Each needs its own
spec → plan → chain.

| 2026-07-10 | `01AzJBSa` | Bare `process.env` read in the isomorphic core → `ReferenceError` in a `<script>` bundle                      | `platform/platform-client/shared.ts:29` — fixed in Task 7                       |
| 2026-07-10 | `01AzJBSa` | The tripwire walks **imports**; it cannot see globals (`process`/`window`/`document`)                         | `src/index.isomorphic.test.ts` — fixed in Task 7                                |
| 2026-07-10 | `01AzJBSa` | Nothing installs and imports the tarball. `npm pack --dry-run` lists contents only                            | `.github/workflows/package-tests.yml` — Task 2                                  |
| 2026-07-10 | `ab099b6a` | Plan's smoke script can't install: staged `workspace:*` dep pins `@kortix/llm-catalog@0.0.0-smoke`, absent from npm. Fixed per Jay: pack + install the sibling tarball alongside | `packages/sdk/scripts/smoke-install.mjs` — Task 2 |
| 2026-07-10 | `ab099b6a` | **`createServerKortix` does not exist.** Plan (`:253,991`) and spec (`:158`) assert it from `./server`; real exports are `createScopedKortix`, `runWithKortix`, `getScopedConfig` (`src/server.ts`). Also affects Task 6's Lumen snippet | `docs/superpowers/{plans,specs}/2026-07-10-*` — Task 2/6 |
| 2026-07-10 | `ab099b6a` | Docs prose says 25 subpaths / 21 legacy; reality is 23 export keys / 20 legacy. Plan's enumerated key lists (Task 5 Step 9) match reality exactly | `packages/sdk/package.json` |
| 2026-07-10 | `ab099b6a` | Plan's `createCliToken` facade name is fictional; real facade method is `kortix.project(id).tokens.create(input?)` (→ `createProjectCliToken`). `gateway.sessions(days?)` was correct | `packages/sdk/src/core/client/kortix.ts:303` — found in Task 6 |
| 2026-07-10 | `ab099b6a` | Demo e2e harness memoizes builds on `.next/BUILD_ID` — e2e runs silently exercise STALE builds after source changes; must clear `.next` (or fix the harness) for trustworthy runs | `apps/whitelabel-demo/tests/e2e/harness.ts` (`ensureBuilt()`) |
| 2026-07-10 | `ab099b6a` | Original preview-token malformed-200 guard was itself broken: `upstreamRes.status \|\| 502` returns 200 on that path, so the "error" response shipped as HTTP 200. Fixed by the Task 6 rewrite (now a real 502, e2e-covered) | `apps/whitelabel-demo/src/app/api/preview-token/route.ts` (pre-`19e500e50`) |
| 2026-07-10 | `ab099b6a` | **CRITICAL (final review): the CDN claim is unfulfillable by the release pipeline.** Publish runs tsc only (`publish-npm-package.sh:36`; `prepublishOnly` tsc-only) so tsup bundles never land in the tarball; `stage-npm-publish.mjs:37` promotes only `type/main/types/exports/files/bin`, so `browser`/`unpkg`/`jsdelivr` stay nested in `publishConfig` where npm/unpkg/jsDelivr never look; nothing validates them at release. Plan flaw (plan `:1253-1278` said "pass through untouched"), faithfully implemented. Decision with Jay: wire the pipeline vs walk back the README/CHANGELOG claim | `scripts/{publish-npm-package.sh,stage-npm-publish.mjs}`, `packages/sdk/{README,CHANGELOG}.md` |
| 2026-07-10 | `ab099b6a` | `bundle.test.ts` never executes in CI (no workflow runs `build:bundles` → both tests skip forever) and NO workflow runs `pnpm --filter @kortix/sdk typecheck` at all (examples' "typechecked in CI" claim is local-only). Two cheap CI steps close both | `.github/workflows/package-tests.yml` |
| 2026-07-10 | `4003a41b` | GETTING-STARTED step 3 was un-followable: the web "API keys" tab's **Create button only rendered in the empty state**, and the executor auto-mints "Executor Session" tokens, so real accounts never see it — no way to mint a PAT from the UI. Fixed (uncommitted, this worktree): `CreateApiKeyAction` header button + regression test; doc wording updated ("CLI tokens tab" → "API keys") | `apps/web/src/features/accounts/settings/cli-tokens-tab.tsx`, `packages/sdk/GETTING-STARTED.md` |
| 2026-07-10 | `4003a41b` | **`ensureReady()` is single-shot** — one `/start` with `wait_ms=30_000`, then throws `RUNTIME_UNAVAILABLE`; a cold provision (observed: minutes) makes EVERY ensureReady example (02/04/06/07) fail — callers must hand-roll a retry loop (examples 09/step4 in this worktree do). Live-observed worse: the server returned near-instantly ~99× in 5min (long-poll not held), and one session went provisioning→stopped and then **disappeared from `projects.sessions()`**. SDK DX gap: `ensureReady({ deadlineMs })` or documented retry | `packages/sdk/src/core/client/kortix.ts:674` (verified live against local stack) |
| 2026-07-10 | `4003a41b` | Local-stack default-agent sends fail: gateway forwards opencode's `max_tokens` to a model demanding `max_completion_tokens` (OpenAI `unsupported_parameter`, HTTP 400) → default `send()` turns error with no assistant reply. Workaround verified live: per-send model override `{ providerID: 'kortix', modelID: 'claude-sonnet-4.6' }` → full e2e pass. Platform fix belongs in the gateway param translation or default model config | `/v1/llm-gateway/v1/llm/chat/completions` (via tunnel), `apps/api/src/router/routes/proxy/helpers.ts:252` |
| 2026-07-11 | `4003a41b` | `session.transcript()` on a session whose sandbox was re-provisioned returns `{available:false, reason:"…ZlibError fetching …/session/<old opencode id>/message…"}` — graceful, but the compact transcript is unreadable after a sandbox swap (stale opencode session id?). Observed live on the local stack | `packages/sdk/src/core/rest/projects-client/sessions.ts` (`getSessionTranscript`) |
| 2026-07-11 | `4003a41b` | `sandboxShares.list(sandboxId)` (`GET /p/share?sandbox_id=…`) returns **502** on the local stack for a live, ready sandbox — session `publicShares` create/list/revoke on the same sandbox works fine. SDK surfaces it correctly as typed ApiError; route itself looks broken/misrouted locally | `packages/sdk/src/core/rest/projects-client/sandbox-shares.ts:33` |

## Open decisions


| Question                                    | Owner | Status                                                                                                                                                              |

| Second `KortixProject` name                 | Jay   | **RESOLVED** — platform keeps `KortixProject`; the kortix-master daemon's becomes `KortixMasterProject`, aliased                                                    |
| Rename `ApiError` → `KortixApiError`?       | Jay   | **RESOLVED — no.** Package name already namespaces the import; `.name` is duck-typed (B4); `instanceof` is the branch mechanism. Prefix only for genuine ambiguity. |
| "Shift the cortex tab to SDK" — what is it? | Jay   | **OPEN.** May re-order everything if it names work Marko is waiting on.                                                                                             |

## Standing facts (verified — don't re-derive)

- Baseline: **1046 tests pass, 0 fail, 65 files.** `typecheck` exits 0. Fewer tests
in your run means you filtered by accident.
- `@kortix/sdk` is **live on npm**, `latest` = `0.9.100`. **Never edit `version`** —
`scripts/stage-npm-publish.mjs:32` overwrites it from the root `VERSION`.
- `bun test <dir with no test files>` exits **0**. `Ran 0 tests` is not a green run.
- Streaming is `fetch` + `response.body.pipeThrough(TextDecoderStream)`, **not**
`EventSource`. It **cannot run on React Native**.
- The 21 legacy subpaths are imported at **340 sites**. They get deprecated aliases, never deletion.co

## Session log

Append only. Newest at the bottom. One entry per session, even a short one.

### 2026-07-10 — session `01AzJBSa`

Brainstormed → spec → plan → execution prompt → this tracker. **No source code touched.**

**Written**

- `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-07-10-sdk-v2-structure-and-distribution-design.md`
- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-10-sdk-v2-structure-and-distribution.md`
- `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-10-sdk-v2-execution-prompt.md`
- `packages/sdk/AGENTS.md` (+ `CLAUDE.md` symlink), root `AGENTS.md` pointer
- `packages/sdk/PROGRESS.md` (this file)

**Found** — see *Discovered this session*. The load-bearing ones: `0.3.0` was
impossible; `KortixProject` was declared twice; nothing tests an install; the
tripwire can't see globals; the SDK can't stream on RN and `apps/mobile` quietly
works around it with 655 parallel lines.

**Verified**

```
pnpm --filter @kortix/sdk typecheck  → exit 0
pnpm --filter @kortix/sdk test       → 1046 pass, 0 fail, 4381 assertions, 65 files
npm view @kortix/sdk version         → 0.9.100
```

**Unverified:** nothing — no source changed.

**Shippable to production: YES** (docs only).
**Next:** Task 1.

### 2026-07-10 — session `ab099b6a`

Executing the v2 chain via subagent-driven development. Docs committed
(`6cd4d6e4e`); baseline re-verified (typecheck exit 0; 1046 pass / 0 fail / 65
files).

**Task 1 DONE** (`ecb78a113`) — `src/package-exports.test.ts`, probe-verified
RED then green. Suite now **1048 pass / 66 files**. Review clean, one
plan-mandated finding for Jay: the plan's test code contains a tautological
assertion (`package-exports.test.ts:30`) that asserts nothing.

**Task 2 BLOCKED at the kickoff's hard stop #1** — the smoke script's
first-ever run failed in Step 2:

```
npm error notarget No matching version found for @kortix/llm-catalog@0.0.0-smoke
```

Root cause: `stage-npm-publish.mjs` rewrites `workspace:*` deps to the lockstep
version. Under `VERSION=0.0.0-smoke` the tarball depends on
`@kortix/llm-catalog@0.0.0-smoke`, which is not on npm, so `npm install
<tarball>` cannot resolve. This is the plan's known risk #2 realised — a design
gap in the smoke script (AGENTS.md documents the pinning behaviour), not a bug
in the published artifact. Real releases co-publish both packages, so prod
installs are unaffected. Also found: the script leaks the packed `.tgz` on
failure (cleanup sits outside `finally`). Fix decision is Jay's; the verbatim
script sits uncommitted at `packages/sdk/scripts/smoke-install.mjs`.

**Also found** — docs prose says 25 subpaths / 21 legacy; reality is 23 export
keys / 20 legacy. The plan's enumerated key lists (Task 5 Step 9) match reality
exactly, so the plan's literal instructions are unaffected.

**Task 2 resumed and BLOCKED a second time.** Jay approved packing the
workspace sibling (`@kortix/llm-catalog` staged at the same synthetic version,
both tarballs installed together — hermetic, mirrors the lockstep release);
that fix works and the ETARGET failure is gone. The smoke then failed at the
final ESM import with a NEW finding:

```
SyntaxError: The requested module '@kortix/sdk/server' does not provide an
export named 'createServerKortix'
```

`createServerKortix` exists nowhere in the SDK — it is a plan/spec authoring
error (plan `:253,991`; spec `:158`). The real `./server` exports are
`createScopedKortix` (`src/server.ts:123`), `runWithKortix`, `getScopedConfig`.
Task 6's Lumen snippet uses the same phantom name. Decision with Jay: assert
the real name and correct the docs, or add `createServerKortix` as new API.
Tautology in `package-exports.test.ts` removed per Jay (`4e39bb11e`).

**Continuation of session `ab099b6a` — the full chain.** Jay resolved both
Task 2 stops (pack the `@kortix/llm-catalog` sibling into the smoke install;
assert the real `createScopedKortix`, docs corrected in `2a7a3e56c`). From
there the chain ran task-by-task with a fresh implementer + independent
reviewer per task, fixes re-reviewed:

- **Task 2 DONE** `7220e9587` — first-ever pack→install→import, hermetic
  (both tarballs), wired into CI.
- **Task 3 DONE** `84e15ca72` — snapshot (23 subpaths / 833 runtime names)
  approved by Jay at hard stop #2. Suite 1049/67.
- **Task 4 DONE** `25068d272..4c6f7102c` (4 commits) — 146 files moved into
  core/browser/node + turns split; snapshot byte-identical; tier tripwire
  armed. Fixed a real pre-existing order-dependent `mock.module` isolation
  bug by rewriting `core/files/client.test.ts` mocking (zero `expect()` lines
  changed — verified twice). Suite 1050/67.
- **Task 5 DONE** `b5e588dbc`+`aafbdf91b` (orchestrator-implemented) —
  `KortixMasterProject` rename with aliases; canonical root barrel (26→518
  root names); 20 deprecated shims + 5 ./internal/*; both maps rewritten to
  28 keys; snapshot growth (+523/-0) accepted by Jay at hard stop #3. Suite
  1058/68; hosts compile untouched.
- **Task 6 DONE** `db30c6df3`+`19e500e50` — demo on root entry;
  `createScopedKortix` replaces raw transport (real names: `tokens.create`,
  `gateway.sessions`); fix restored the malformed-200 guard as a true 502
  with a RED-watched e2e (44/3/0 on a fresh build).
- **Task 7 DONE** `189428df7`+`a485ad401` — bare-globals tripwire (guard
  window per-global, comment-safe after probe-RED fix); `safeEnv` →
  `core/http/env.ts`; `shared.ts:29` fixed. Suite 1059/68.
- **Task 8 DONE** `c7bca7a7e` — tsup bundles (`kortix.esm.min.js`,
  `kortix.global.js` IIFE via `outExtension` — tsup would otherwise emit
  `.global.global.js`); zero `node:` specifiers in either bundle. Built
  suite 1061/69.
- **Task 9 steps 1–5 DONE** `549d597a0` — `07-vanilla.ts` (render loop
  corrected to the real API per examples/04), `08-cdn.html`, examples
  tripwire (+B6: the regex is blind to side-effect imports). Suite 1062/69
  built. **Step 6 (browser + live stack, D2a/D3) awaits Jay — hard stop #4.**
- **Task 10 DONE** `6e9cc9f5a` — README/CHANGELOG/API-MAP; count corrected
  to 20; `createScopedKortix` documented; RN-streaming not claimed.

**Final whole-branch review: "With fixes."** Purely-additive surface
re-verified independently. One CRITICAL: the README/CHANGELOG CDN claim is
unfulfillable by the release pipeline (see Discovered table) — wire it or
walk it back before merge. Important: bundle tests never run in CI;
no CI job runs the SDK typecheck. Minors triaged as follow-ups.

**Verified this session (final state):** typecheck exit 0; unbuilt suite
1060 pass / 2 skip / 69 files; built suite 1062 pass / 0 fail / 69 files;
`smoke:install` ✔; whitelabel-demo typecheck 0 + e2e 44/3/0; apps/web zero
SDK resolution errors.

**Unverified:** D2a/D3 (browser streaming + `instanceof` under the IIFE) —
Task 9 Step 6, needs Jay's live stack; the release pipeline path for the
bundles (the CRITICAL above); CI runs of the new workflow steps on Actions.

**Shippable to production: NOT YET** — pending Jay: CDN-claim decision,
README domain decision (`api.kortix.ai` vs `.com`), CI-gate fixes, and the
Task 9 Step 6 browser gate.

**Fix wave (same session, after Jay's decisions).** Jay chose: wire the CDN
pipeline, `api.kortix.com`, both CI gates now.

- `33f45e6f8` — `stage-npm-publish.mjs` promotes `browser`/`unpkg`/`jsdelivr`
  if present and hard-fails (`process.exit(1)`) when a promoted path is
  missing from the build (TDD in `stage-npm-publish.test.mjs`, RED watched,
  24/24). The load-bearing build fix went into `publish-npm-package.sh`
  (staging runs BEFORE `npm publish`, so `prepublishOnly` alone fires too
  late); `prepublishOnly && tsup` kept as defense-in-depth; the two other
  staging call sites (`smoke-install.mjs`, CI dry-pack loop) also build
  bundles — required, or the new validation would redline them. Tarball
  simulation: both bundles in the tarball, top-level CDN fields staged,
  manifests restored byte-identical. Siblings (llm-catalog, executor-sdk)
  provably unaffected (promote-if-present; pinned by test).
- `695908713` — README standardized on `api.kortix.com` (Jay's call).
- `e48a48489` — `package-tests.yml`: SDK typecheck step + `build:bundles`
  before the test run, so `bundle.test.ts` executes in CI (1062/0/69).

**Final re-review: "Ready to merge — Yes."** All findings closed by the named
mechanisms; the two call-site fixes judged required, not scope creep. Minor
follow-ups noted: triple bundle build in one CI job (~1 min redundant,
idempotent); redundant rebuild via prepublishOnly inside the scripted release.

**Remaining before the branch is DONE-done: Task 9 Step 6 only** (Jay: real
browser + live stack + real PAT/sandbox → D2a streaming through the IIFE
global, D3 `instanceof Kortix.ApiError` under the bundle).

**Shippable to production: NOT YET** — solely on the unverified D2a/D3
browser gate. Everything else is implemented, reviewed, and green.
### 2026-07-11 — session `b35eea56`

Jay-directed addition, outside the Now chain: `examples/step5-change-model.ts`
— change a project's default model with a compile-time-safe `ManagedModelId`
literal union (pinned in-file, startup-verified against `MANAGED_MODELS` from
`@kortix/llm-catalog` — first example to import the catalog; resolves fine
under `examples/tsconfig.json`). Defaults to Jay's project
`4cfe8027-5260-44d7-871b-ccd36368f63f`. Verified: typecheck exit 0 (bad model
id probe-confirmed RED → TS2345, then restored green); full flow ran live
against localhost:8008 (set → re-read ✓), then the project's prior default
(`openai/gpt-5.5`) was restored. Suite 1062 pass / 0 fail / 69 files. Note:
bun auto-loads `packages/sdk/.env.local` (holds `KORTIX_API_KEY`) — that is
how examples authenticate when run from the package dir.

### 2026-07-12 — Production-readiness review (Jay-requested, pre-merge): Task 9 Step 6 EXECUTED (PASS) + fix wave F1–F7

Fresh end-to-end review of the whole branch (41 commits vs `main`, base
`808fadfc8`): two-axis sub-agent review (standards + spec) over the full diff,
17-point distribution/CI fact-check (17/17 VERIFIED), all gates re-run, and the
**Task 9 Step 6 browser gate finally executed against a live stack**. Full report:
`docs/superpowers/reviews/2026-07-12-sdk-production-readiness.md`.

**D2a — PASS.** `examples/08-cdn.html` served from `:8099`, loaded in real
Chromium (Playwright) via `<script src=…kortix.global.js>` against `pnpm dev` +
fresh session `4f2953bc…` (project t1, real PAT, real sandbox). Page output:
`sent — streaming…` then `· message.part.updated` ×7 through `· session.idle`.
**D3 — PASS.** A bundle-thrown `ApiError` (`kortix.ts:681`) satisfied
`error instanceof Kortix.ApiError` in page script (branch printed
`ApiError undefined: Session runtime not ready`); a bad-PAT run threw
`SessionStartError` and correctly took the non-ApiError branch (extends `Error`
by design). **Discovery:** first attempt was CORS-blocked — the API allowlist
(`apps/api/src/index.ts:151-202`) has no `:8099`; local repro needs
`CORS_ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:8099`. The CDN story only works from
allowlisted origins → product decision for Jay (in the report), docs now say so.

**Fix wave (UNCOMMITTED in working tree, reviewed "Approved" / spec ✅ ×7):**
F1 smoke-install finally-block made throw-safe (AggregateError, restore-first);
F2 stale JSDoc path fixed; F3+F7 side-effect-import blindness fixed everywhere
(shared `importSpecifiers`, RED-proven) — **closes B6**; F4 AGENTS.md stale
claims fixed (export-map + install-smoke guards now exist; baseline 1069/71);
F5 **new `public-type-surface.test.ts` + snapshot** (TS compiler API) — type-only
exports (`SessionHandle`, `ClassifiedPart`, …) are now rename-guarded, closing
the runtime snapshot's type blindness; F6 CORS constraint documented
(README + 08-cdn.html). Details + RED evidence: `.superpowers/sdd/fix-wave-2-report.md`.

**Verified:** typecheck exit 0 · full suite **1069 pass / 0 fail / 71 files**
(reproduced independently by implementer AND reviewer) · smoke:install OK ·
build:bundles OK (esm 189.90 KB, iife 190.88 KB).
**Unverified:** npm Trusted Publishing wiring for the `@kortix` org
(publish-npm-package.sh skips silently without OIDC/token — one-time infra
check, outside the repo); Safari/Workers legs of the runtime matrix.

**Shippable to production: YES** — supersedes the 2026-07-11 "NOT YET"
(its sole blocker, D2a/D3, is now observed passing). Remaining for Jay:
commit/merge decision (fix wave is uncommitted by request), CDN CORS policy,
Trusted Publishing check.

---

### 2026-07-12 — session `gateway-fallbacks`: B7 provider-qualified default lock

The platform gateway default is now `codex/gpt-5.6-sol`, but it remains a
Kortix gateway wire model in the picker: `{ providerID: 'kortix', modelID:
'codex/gpt-5.6-sol' }`. This deliberately does not expose or classify it as a
native OpenCode `codex` provider. Implementation: `ee7d2cc09`.

**TDD/regression evidence:** the focused picker regression is green (14 pass,
0 fail). Final full SDK suite: **1076 pass / 0 fail / 72 files** and **4958
expect() calls**. `pnpm --filter @kortix/sdk typecheck` exited 0, and
`pnpm --filter @kortix/sdk smoke:install` packed, installed, imported, and
constructed the published package successfully.

**Cross-package evidence:** gateway **144 pass / 0 fail**; catalog **25 pass /
0 fail**; focused API resolution/catalog/entitlement suite **45 pass / 0
fail**; standalone gateway server **13 pass / 0 fail**. Typechecks exited 0
for gateway, catalog, SDK, API, and standalone gateway. `git diff --check`
was clean.

**Real local E2E:** through `POST http://localhost:20908/v1/llm-gateway/v1/chat/completions`,
streaming `auto` selected `openai-codex` / `gpt-5.6-sol` and returned the exact
marker `AUTO_DEFAULT_CODEX_56_SOL_OK`; forced Codex 401 selected OpenRouter /
`z-ai/glm-5.2-20260616`, returned `CODEX_STREAM_401_TO_GLM_OK`, completed with
`[DONE]`, and persisted routing metadata selecting `glm-5.2`. Non-streaming
Codex primary and forced-401 fallback also returned exact markers. Temporary
gateway credentials were revoked and the Codex-secret mutation was restored.

**Shippable to production: YES** — SDK public behavior is regression-locked;
the wider gateway change still follows its normal PR, deploy-dev, and live-dev
verification lifecycle.

---

### 2026-07-13 — session `session-base-branches` (claim)

Claimed the user-directed additive branch-environment work: preserve the existing
per-session `base_ref` API, expose effective project/group branch defaults through
the typed project Git surface, and extend group-grant mutations without renaming or
removing public SDK symbols. TDD will be RED-watched before implementation; the
full SDK typecheck, test, and packed-install smoke gates are required before this
claim is closed.

**Status:** IN PROGRESS.

---

### 2026-07-13 — session `session-base-branches` (completion)

Completed the additive session branch-environment surface in implementation
commit `0843d870c`: `ProjectBranchesResponse` now reports the caller's effective
session default and group-conflict metadata, while project group grants accept
an optional nullable `default_base_ref`. Existing names and required fields are
unchanged; compatibility with older servers is preserved through optional
response fields.

**TDD/regression evidence:** the focused cross-package run passed **103 tests / 0
failures** across the SDK access client, API branch resolver, DB schema, and web
session-create input. The real isolated API then proved: attached group default
`staging` -> persisted session `base_ref: staging`; explicit `dev` -> persisted
`base_ref: dev`; conflicting `dev`/`staging` group defaults -> project `dev` with
`session_default_conflict: true`; PATCH `default_base_ref: null` -> effective
default returned to `staging`. Both sessions retained their generated UUID as
`branch_name`.

**Final SDK gates:** `pnpm --filter @kortix/sdk typecheck` exited 0;
`pnpm --filter @kortix/sdk test` reported **1077 pass / 2 skip / 0 fail** across
72 files with 4955 assertions; `pnpm --filter @kortix/sdk run smoke:install`
packed, installed, imported, and constructed `@kortix/sdk` successfully.

**Shippable to production: YES** for the SDK surface. The two skipped tests are
the existing browser-bundle tests that only execute after `build:bundles`; this
change does not touch bundles or runtime transport.

### 2026-07-13 — session `remove-freestyle`: B8 project-app surface removal

Completed the explicitly subtractive SDK portion in implementation commit
`ec8b44dda`: removed the project-app REST module, `project(id).apps` facade,
associated public types, playground example, API map/docs references, and the
corresponding runtime/type public-surface snapshot entries. No compatibility
alias remains because the underlying platform capability itself was removed.

**Final SDK gates:** `pnpm --filter @kortix/sdk typecheck` exited 0;
`pnpm --filter @kortix/sdk test` reported **1079 pass / 0 fail** across 72 files
with 4921 assertions; `pnpm --filter @kortix/sdk run smoke:install` built,
packed, installed, imported, and constructed the published package successfully.

**Shippable to production: YES** for the SDK subtraction. Repository delivery,
deployment, and the separate forward database-schema removal remain tracked by
the parent removal goal.

---

### 2026-07-13 — session `remove-app-deploy-residue`: B8 documentation follow-up

Removed stale affirmative references to the retired project-app deployment
surface from the SDK README and API map as part of the repository-wide starter
and documentation cleanup. No SDK source, export, type, or runtime behavior
changed; the B8 removal record remains as the audit trail.

**Final SDK gates:** `pnpm --filter @kortix/sdk typecheck` exited 0;
`pnpm --filter @kortix/sdk test` reported **1079 pass / 0 fail** across 72 files
with 4921 assertions after bundle generation; `pnpm --filter @kortix/sdk run
smoke:install` built, packed, installed, imported, and constructed the published
package successfully.

**Shippable to production: YES** — documentation-only SDK follow-up with the
full published-package gates green.

---

### 2026-07-13 — session `gateway-routing-ui` (claim)

Claimed the user-directed additive project LLM routing-policy surface: persisted
default and vision models, an ordered default fallback chain, exact-model
overrides, bounded `transient` / `any-error` conditions, and a route-preview
contract exposed through `@kortix/sdk` for the Customize UI. Existing model
default names and behavior remain unchanged. SDK work will follow RED → GREEN →
REFACTOR and finish on the full typecheck, test, and packed-install smoke gates.

**Status:** IN PROGRESS.

---

### 2026-07-13 — session `gateway-routing-ui` (completion)

Completed the additive project LLM routing-policy SDK surface: typed whole-document
CRUD and route preview functions, `project(id).gateway.routing.{get,set,reset,preview}`,
and `useGatewayRoutingPolicy` with project-scoped caching/invalidation. Runtime and
type public-surface snapshots contain additions only; no existing SDK name or contract
was removed or renamed.

**Focused evidence:** routing transport/facade/hook tests passed **65 / 0** together
with the existing facade suite. The isolated black-box `GW-4` flow passed **1 / 0**
against the real API and a provisioned project, covering persisted save/read-back,
default and exact route preview, invalid-policy preservation, access boundaries, and
reset.

**Final SDK gates:** `pnpm --filter @kortix/sdk typecheck` exited 0;
`pnpm --filter @kortix/sdk test` reported **1083 pass / 0 fail** across 74 files with
4936 assertions; `pnpm --filter @kortix/sdk run smoke:install` built, packed,
installed, imported, and constructed `@kortix/sdk` successfully.

**Shippable to production: YES** for the SDK surface. Repository merge, Deploy Dev,
and live-dev verification remain part of the parent feature lifecycle.

---

### 2026-07-13 — session `e2b-provider`: B9 unified E2B provider contract

Completed the provider contract in `5763b63e4`: E2B is selectable and observable
through the published SDK alongside Daytona and Platinum. Retired standalone
instance exports remain import-compatible as deprecated fail-closed stubs, while
the supported sandbox-provider union is exactly `daytona | platinum | e2b`.

**TDD/regression evidence:** focused E2B and retired-provider type/runtime tests
passed before the final suite. Final SDK gates: `pnpm --filter @kortix/sdk
typecheck` exited 0; `pnpm --filter @kortix/sdk test` reported **1083 pass / 0
fail** across 74 files with 4985 assertions; `pnpm --filter @kortix/sdk run
smoke:install` packed, installed, imported, and constructed `@kortix/sdk`
successfully.

**Shippable to production: YES** for the SDK surface.

---

### 2026-07-13 — session `personal-session-branch` (claim)

Claimed the user-directed personal session-branch preference work. This adds an
additive SDK/API contract for a project-scoped current-user default and makes
session base-ref resolution honor it before group and project defaults. No
existing public names or required fields will be changed. SDK work will follow
RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR and finish with typecheck, full suite, and packed-install
smoke evidence.

**Status:** IN PROGRESS.

---

### 2026-07-13 — session `personal-session-branch` (abandoned)

Abandoned the personal/group session-branch preference claim by explicit product
decision. Branch choice belongs to an ordinary isolated Kortix project: users may
connect the same Git repository more than once, choose an existing branch during
project creation, and keep each project's secrets, access, sessions, triggers,
deployments, and runtime settings independent. The advanced per-session `base_ref`
API remains compatible, but no preference hierarchy or environment entity will be
added.

**Status:** WON'T DO (superseded by independent same-repository projects).

---

### 2026-07-13 — session `personal-session-branch` (replacement completion)

Completed the replacement project-as-environment SDK surface. GitHub imports can
now discover existing repository branches through the typed
`kortix.github.listRepositoryBranches(accountId, installationId, repoFullName)`
facade. A Kortix project owns one selected repository branch as its canonical
`default_branch`; no personal/group preference hierarchy remains in the SDK.
Existing per-session `base_ref` support remains backward compatible.

**Final SDK gates:** `pnpm --filter @kortix/sdk typecheck` exited 0;
`pnpm --filter @kortix/sdk test` reported **1085 pass / 0 fail** across 77 files
with 4960 assertions; `pnpm --filter @kortix/sdk smoke:install` built, packed,
installed, imported, and constructed `@kortix/sdk` successfully.

**Shippable to production: YES** — the public addition is typed, additive,
snapshot-locked, and verified from the packed package.

---

### 2026-07-13 — session `gateway-routing-ux` (claim)

Claimed the user-directed LLM Gateway routing UX simplification. The SDK scope is
an additive compact project model-picker REST surface so chat and settings model
selectors no longer download the full 5,262-model runtime catalog. The existing
`llm-catalog`, model-default, and routing-policy APIs remain backward compatible.
Implementation will follow RED -> GREEN -> REFACTOR and finish with the full SDK
typecheck, test, and packed-install smoke gates.

**Status:** IN PROGRESS.

### 2026-07-13 — session `gateway-routing-ux` (completion)

Completed the additive compact project model-picker SDK surface. The project
transport and `createKortix().project(id).models.picker()` facade now load the
connection-aware picker projection rather than the full runtime catalog, while
the existing `llm-catalog` API remains available and unchanged. React project
model/provider hooks share the compact project cache, and model visibility now
uses an indexed lookup instead of repeatedly scanning the catalog. Runtime and
type public-surface snapshots contain additions only.

The surrounding product flow now uses the shared model selector for the single
project-default control and every fallback choice. Routing saves and project-
default writes are mutually excluded through a shared mutation key, and an
effective-default refetch cannot replace unsaved fallback edits.

**Final SDK gates:** `pnpm --filter @kortix/sdk typecheck` exited 0;
`pnpm --filter @kortix/sdk test` reported **1094 pass / 0 fail** across 79 files
with 4988 assertions; `pnpm --filter @kortix/sdk smoke:install` built, packed,
installed, imported, and constructed `@kortix/sdk` successfully.

**Shippable to production: YES** — the SDK change is additive, snapshot-locked,
install-verified, and backed by the real local compact-picker API flow.

---

### 2026-07-13 — session `sandbox-template-provider-readiness` (claim)

Claimed the additive provider-aware sandbox-template observation contract. The
template API will expose current launch readiness independently for Daytona,
Platinum, and E2B while retaining every existing response field. The web host
will consume that typed SDK contract instead of interpreting the legacy
Daytona-named field as universal provider truth.

**Status:** IN PROGRESS.

---

### 2026-07-13 — session `sandbox-template-provider-readiness` (completion)

Completed the additive provider-aware template contract. Sandbox template
responses now type independent Daytona, Platinum, and E2B launch-readiness
observations, routed provider mode, and exact provider attribution for new build
rows. Reusable template builds fan out to every enabled provider independently
of project routing pins. Existing fields and exported names remain compatible.

**TDD evidence:** the initial typecheck failed because `provider_coverage` was
absent, then passed after the additive contract was implemented. Final SDK gates:
`pnpm --filter @kortix/sdk typecheck` exited 0; `pnpm --filter @kortix/sdk test`
reported **1095 pass / 0 fail** across 80 files with 4990 assertions;
`pnpm --filter @kortix/sdk run smoke:install` built, packed, installed, imported,
and constructed `@kortix/sdk` successfully.

**Shippable to production: YES** for the SDK surface. Parent API/UI rollout and
live provider verification remain part of the enclosing change.

---

### 2026-07-13 — session `sandbox-template-provider-status-v2` (completion)

Completed the follow-up provider-status and failure-recovery contract on top of
the provider-neutral synchronization rollout. The additive rebuild response can
now report providers that failed before their rebuild was started, while the UI
keeps Automatic neutral and shows selected-provider plus current-image status
only for pinned projects. Existing provider readiness and `launch_ready` fields
remain backward compatible.

**Final SDK gates:** `pnpm --filter @kortix/sdk typecheck` exited 0;
`pnpm --filter @kortix/sdk test` reported **1094 pass / 2 skip / 0 fail**
across 80 files with 4986 assertions; `pnpm --filter @kortix/sdk run smoke:install` built,
packed, installed, imported, and constructed `@kortix/sdk` successfully.

**Shippable to production: YES** for the SDK surface. API/web typechecks,
focused provider tests, and UI lint also pass; live dev verification remains the
enclosing rollout gate.

---

### 2026-07-15 - Studio Phase 1 claim

Studio Phase 1 SDK work claimed for `docs/specs/2026-07-15-kortix-studio-phase1-implementation-plan.md`.
No SDK implementation code changed in this entry.

**Verified**

```
git status --short --branch -> ## studio-platform
```

**Shippable to production: YES** (claim metadata only).

---

### 2026-07-15 - Studio Phase 1 billing reservation fields

Completed the additive SDK billing shape for Task 5: account-state credits now
surface `reserved` and `available`, and `getDefaultAccountState()` initializes
both to `0`. This is additive only; no SDK public name was removed or renamed.

Also fixed the SDK install smoke script on Windows so its internal package
commands resolve `pnpm.cmd` / `npm.cmd` instead of failing before pack/install.

**Final SDK gates**

```
pnpm.cmd --filter @kortix/sdk typecheck
-> exit 0

pnpm.cmd --filter @kortix/sdk test
-> 1095 pass, 0 fail, 4939 expect() calls, 80 files

pnpm.cmd --filter @kortix/sdk smoke:install
-> OK: @kortix/sdk imports and constructs from a packed tarball
-> install smoke test passed
```

**Shippable to production: YES** for the additive SDK billing fields and Windows
smoke-install fix. The broader Studio Phase 1 rollout remains in progress.

---

### 2026-07-18 - Intelligence protocol contract dependency

Wired the new side-effect-free `@kortix/intelligence-contracts` workspace package
as an SDK dependency so the later project intelligence surface can share one
versioned wire contract. No SDK source files, public exports, or runtime behavior
changed in this step.

**Verified**

```
pnpm.cmd --filter @kortix/sdk typecheck -> exit 0
```

**Shippable to production: YES** for this dependency-only SDK change. The
intelligence protocol implementation remains in its separate execution chain.

---

### 2026-07-18 - Intelligence Fabric Task 5 (completion)

Completed the additive shared Intelligence SDK surface. Project handles now
expose capability listing/discovery, Agent Cards, task creation, and cursor-
scoped task events; the existing React export adds project-scoped query and
mutation bindings. Public runtime/type snapshots contain additions only.

The client now parses every Intelligence 2xx envelope against a strict
allowlisted shape before returning it, rejects unknown protocol revisions,
credential-like keys (including camelCase raw provider fields), credential text,
URLs/schemes, and sanitizes transport/serialization/cursor errors. The publish
topology now includes the side-effect-free contracts package, stages smoke
copies without mutating source manifests, and selects an npm token only for a
new-package bootstrap before returning to OIDC.

**Final verification evidence**

```
pnpm.cmd --filter @kortix/sdk typecheck -> exit 0
pnpm.cmd --filter @kortix/sdk test -> 1111 pass, 0 fail, 5062 expect() calls
pnpm.cmd --filter @kortix/sdk build -> exit 0
pnpm.cmd --filter @kortix/sdk run smoke:install -> Install smoke test passed
pnpm.cmd --filter @kortix/intelligence-contracts test -> 9 pass, 0 fail
pnpm.cmd --filter @kortix/intelligence-contracts typecheck -> exit 0
node scripts/stage-npm-publish.test.mjs -> 28 assertions passed
bash -n scripts/publish-npm-package.sh -> exit 0
```

The registry still returns 404 for `@kortix/intelligence-contracts`; no real
npm publication or OIDC run was attempted. The first release therefore remains
gated on a restricted `NPM_TOKEN`, followed by npm Trusted Publisher setup.

**Shippable to production: YES** for the source/package contract; external npm
publication and the durable Task 6 bridge remain separate release gates.

---

### 2026-07-19 - Intelligence Workflow Task 11 (completion)

Completed the additive shared workflow surface from
`docs/plans/2026-07-18-intelligence-workflow-evaluation-plan.md`. The SDK now
exposes project-scoped workflow start/read/cancel/events/approval transports,
the `createKortix().project(id).intelligence.workflows` facade, React Query
reads/mutations, and project-scoped invalidation. Runtime/type snapshots contain
additions only; no existing Intelligence name was removed or renamed.

The CLI appends `workflow_capabilities`, `workflow_start`, and
`workflow_status` after the existing MCP tools, negotiates only `2025-11-25`
and `2025-06-18`, and revalidates injected responses before stdout. The API adds
human-only approval decisions plus a strict project Agent-trusted A2A workflow
adapter with run-as-context state mapping and parent task propagation.

**Final verification evidence**

```
pnpm.cmd --filter @kortix/sdk typecheck -> exit 0
pnpm.cmd --filter @kortix/sdk test -> 1116 pass, 0 fail, 5086 expect() calls, 83 files
pnpm.cmd --filter @kortix/sdk smoke:install -> Install smoke test passed
pnpm.cmd --filter @kortix/api-contract test -> 49 pass, 0 fail
pnpm.cmd --filter @kortix/api-contract typecheck -> exit 0
pnpm.cmd --filter kortix-api exec bun test src/intelligence -> 185 pass, 0 fail
pnpm.cmd --filter kortix-api typecheck -> exit 0
pnpm.cmd --filter @kortix/cli typecheck -> exit 0
pnpm.cmd --filter @kortix/cli exec bun test src/__tests__/executor-intelligence-mcp.test.ts src/__tests__/e2e-intelligence-mcp.test.ts -> 24 pass, 0 fail
git diff --check -> exit 0
```

The full CLI suite remains red on the pre-existing Windows/self-host baseline:
251 pass and 24 fail in symlink, AWS/Terraform, and Docker distribution tests.
None of those failures touches the Task 11 files; the focused MCP/HTTP black-box
tests and CLI typecheck are green.

**Shippable to production: YES** for the additive SDK surface. The wider
workflow feature remains disabled by default and the existing unrelated CLI
baseline failures remain a repository-level release risk.
